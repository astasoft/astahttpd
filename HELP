Hi all,

well, even astahttpd is premature project. But I think if it quite mature
and stable it can be used for production server, I hope.... :)

So..., I hope many of you guys help me to improve astahttpd. You can help 
astahttpd in many things such as:

- Join the project (on sourceforge.net)
- Improve the code
- Submit bugs
- Make official website for astahttpd
  (yeah I really need this one, astahttpd.sourceforge.net still blank :( )

If you can do one of that things, please let me know. So CREDITS file 
can be created :) (you know what I mean...???)

sorry for my english....
