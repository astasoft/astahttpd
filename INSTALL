INSTALLING astahttpd on Linux
==============================

Since astahttpd written using PHP, offcourse you need PHP in your box. So let's
try to install PHP first.

For Windows users see file INSTALL_WIN32.txt.

System Requirements
===================
   * Linux OS (Tested with Ubuntu 7.04, kernel version 2.6.20-15)
     (I think it should be work on *BSD system too)
   * PHP >= 5.2.x (Tested with PHP 5.2.3) 
   You can get PHP at http://www.php.net/
   
INSTALLING PHP
==============

   Before starting, I want to remember you that astahttpd needs Sockets 
   extension to be enabled.
   
   Here we go...
   
   1. * Extract PHP source
      $ tar -zxvf php-5.x.x.tar.gz
   2. * CD to extracted directory
      $ cd php-5.x.x
   3. * Do configure
      $ ./configure --enable-sockets --enable-fastcgi
      
      Note: - "--enable-fastcgi" is optional but very recommended to increase
              performance of PHP script significantly.
              
            - You may want add other options such --with-mysql etc. BUT DO
              NOT INSTALL PHP as apache module (--with-apxs or --with-apxs2)
              
            - If you have older PHP instalation in your system, use 
              "--prefix=/path/to/new/location" in configure. So your older PHP
              instalation will never be touch and remain safe.
              
            - As of v0.1-RC1 you don't need to build astahttpd using 
              --enable-pcntl.
              
    4. * Finally make and make install
       $ make
       $ make install
       
       Note: if you want to put the instalation outside your home dir or you
             do not want to get permission trouble, use 
             "sudo make install" instead.
             
    5. Done..., now let's move to next part "INSTALLING astahttpd"
    
====================    
INSTALLING astahttpd
====================

   I assume you will install astahttpd to /home/user directory. You MUST be
   as root when installing astahttpd.
   
   1. * Extract astahttpd source
      $ tar -zxvf astahttpd_x.x-rc1.gz
   2. * CD to extracted directory
      $ cd to astahttpd_x.x-rc1
   3. * Finally do install
      $ sudo ./install.sh
   4. * Instalation is interactive based, so it's very easy.
   5. Done..., that's it? yeah... :)
   
   To run the astahttpd daemon use:
   
   $ /home/user/astahttpd/bin/aws

   Open your web browser and point to http://localhost/ or 
   http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER/ if you use port other than 80.

   * Hit Ctrl-C if you want to quit/stop the daemon.
   

=====================
CONFIGURING astahttpd
=====================

   All server configuration saved in aws.conf.php which located inside conf
   folder on your instalation directory.
   
   By default astahttpd wil run on port 80, you can change 
   this by editing aws.conf.php.
   
   If $aws_conf['doc_root'] is empty, astahttpd will use default htdocs dir.
   

INSTALLING MODULES
==================   

   If you want install module there two main steps:
      
      1. Put the module into modules/ directory
      2. Activate the modules via aws.conf.php file
      
   Here example configuration of modules:
   
      $aws_conf['modules'] = array(
                                 'mod_test'        => 'Off',
                                 'mod_encoding'    => 'On',
                                 'mod_auth_basic'  => 'On',
                                 'mod_auth_digest' => 'On',
                                 'mod_bandwidth'   => 'On',
                                 'mod_cgi'         => 'On',
                                 'mod_cgi_header'  => 'On',
                                 'mod_vhost'       => 'On',
                                 'mod_rewrite'     => 'On',
                                 'mod_status'      => 'On'
                             );      
   
   NOTE:
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   If you want to develop your own module, please follow these rules:
   
      1. Every module MUST extends Module (module.php)
      2. Every module MUST have method named activate() with access public
      3. Call parent::__construct() on your constructor class to make sure 
         everything is assigned properly
      4. Module name must be in lowercase, and if it consist more than one word
         (I think always :)) separate it with underscore.
      5. Module file name must be the same with the class name. If your class 
         module name is mod_test then your module file name must be mod_test.php
         
   Read module.php so you familiar with all the global variables. For quick
   example see file mod_test.php, it will show you the basic. Don't forget 
   to activate it on aws.conf.php.
   

VIRTUAL HOST CONFIGURATION
==========================
   As a developer you may work on multiple projects at the same time. So
   it's better to make real simulation for your project. That's why virtual
   host support was added to astahttpd.
   
   Since v0.1-RC1 the IP based virtual host support was dropped. So only name 
   based virtual hosts is supported since v0.1-RC1
   
   Take a look at aws.conf file located in conf folder. It will gives you a lot
   of example how to configure your virtual host.
   
   Note:
   When you install astahttpd, it modifiy your /etc/hosts file and add these
   content:
   
   127.0.0.1   local.vhost1 local.vhost2
   
   So if you not use astahttpd anymore you may want to delete that line.
