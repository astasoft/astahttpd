INSTALLING astahttpd on Linux
==============================

Since astahttpd written using PHP, offcourse you need PHP in your box. So let's
try to install PHP first.

For Windows users see file INSTALL_WIN32.txt.

System Requirements
===================
   * Linux OS (Tested with Ubuntu 7.04, kernel version 2.6.20-15)
     (I think it should be work on *BSD system too)
   * PHP >= 5.2.x (Tested with PHP 5.2.3) with sockets module enabled
   You can get PHP at http://www.php.net/

INSTALLING PHP
==============

   Before starting, I want to remember you that astahttpd needs Sockets
   extension to be enabled.

   Here we go...

   1. * Extract PHP source
      $ tar -zxvf php-5.x.x.tar.gz
   2. * CD to extracted directory
      $ cd php-5.x.x
   3. * Do configure
      $ ./configure --enable-sockets --enable-fastcgi

      Note: - "--enable-fastcgi" is optional but very recommended to increase
              performance of PHP script significantly.

            - You may want add other options such --with-mysql etc. BUT DO
              NOT INSTALL PHP as apache module (--with-apxs or --with-apxs2)

            - If you have older PHP instalation in your system, use
              "--prefix=/path/to/new/location" in configure. So your older PHP
              instalation will never be touch and remain safe.

            - As of v0.1-RC1 you don't need to build astahttpd using
              --enable-pcntl.

    4. * Finally make and make install
       $ make
       $ make install

       Note: if you want to put the instalation outside your home dir or you
             do not want to get permission trouble, use
             "sudo make install" instead.

    5. Done..., now let's move to next part "INSTALLING astahttpd"

====================
INSTALLING astahttpd
====================

   Installing astahttpd is very simple, you just need do git clone
   from github or download the tarball.

   $ git clone git@github.com:astasoft/astahttpd
   $ cd astahttpd
   $ cp conf/aws.conf.php.sample conf/aws.conf.php
   $ php bin/aws

   Open your web browser and point to http://localhost:8000

   * Hit Ctrl-C if you want to quit/stop the daemon.


=====================
CONFIGURING astahttpd
=====================

   All server configuration saved in aws.conf.php which located inside conf
   folder on your instalation directory.

   By default astahttpd wil run on port 8000, you can change
   this by editing aws.conf.php.

   If $aws_conf['doc_root'] is empty, astahttpd will use default htdocs dir.


INSTALLING MODULES
==================

   If you want install module there two main steps:

      1. Put the module into modules/ directory
      2. Activate the modules via aws.conf.php file

   Here example configuration of modules:

      $aws_conf['modules'] = array(
                                 'mod_test'        => 'Off',
                                 'mod_encoding'    => 'On',
                                 'mod_auth_basic'  => 'On',
                                 'mod_auth_digest' => 'On',
                                 'mod_bandwidth'   => 'On',
                                 'mod_cgi'         => 'On',
                                 'mod_cgi_header'  => 'On',
                                 'mod_vhost'       => 'On',
                                 'mod_rewrite'     => 'On',
                                 'mod_status'      => 'On'
                             );

   NOTE:
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   If you want to develop your own module, please follow these rules:

      1. Every module MUST extends Module (module.php)
      2. Every module MUST have method named activate() with access public
      3. Call parent::__construct() on your constructor class to make sure
         everything is assigned properly
      4. Module name must be in lowercase, and if it consist more than one word
         (I think always) separate it with underscore.
      5. Module file name must be the same with the class name. If your class
         module name is mod_test then your module file name must be mod_test.php

   Read module.php so you familiar with all the global variables. For quick
   example see file mod_test.php, it will show you the basic. Don't forget
   to activate it on aws.conf.php.


VIRTUAL HOST CONFIGURATION
==========================
   As a developer you may work on multiple projects at the same time. So
   it's better to make real simulation for your project. That's why virtual
   host support was added to astahttpd.

   Since v0.1-RC1 the IP based virtual host support was dropped. So only name
   based virtual hosts is supported since v0.1-RC1

   Take a look at aws.conf file located in conf folder. It will gives you a lot
   of example how to configure your virtual host.

   To test virtual host capability on astahttpd edit your /etc/hosts and add
   two hosts 'local.vhost1' and 'local.vhost2'

   127.0.0.1   localhost local.vhost1 local.vhost2

   Then try to access the virtual host using your browser.
   http://local.vhost1:8000/
