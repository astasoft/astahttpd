You need at least PHP 5.2.3 to run astahttpd since it implements OOP style
that only available on PHP5.

astahttpd SHOULD NOT be used in production environment due many performance and
security issue that has not been fixed yet.

The Idea
--------

1)
The idea behind the making of astahttpd is simple, I just need simple
web server for astasms (an sms server written also in pure PHP, I will
released soon :) ). Since astasms front-end is web based, so it needs a web
server. I don't want to use Apache or other mainstream web server player, 
because i think it's too bloated if used only for supporting front-end.

After tried few simple httpd server written by somebody else, but most of them
just make me more frustating. Many of them is really hard to install and 
configure and the worst, i even cannot compile them :( .

So I started to make my own web server using my favorite language PHP. The first
thnik I need to decide is whether to use PHP4 or PHP5. I think OOP in PHP5 
is very good and make software maintanance easier. So I decided to use PHP5.

2)
Just for fun :) .
